### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Sam and I am in the process of retraining to start a career in data science and python development.

## What am I working on? 
I am currently enrolled in the HyperionDev Data Science bootcamp with the aim of entering a data science or python dev role in September 2024, after working as a geography and computer science teacher in the UK. 

## What is my main interest? 
I have an interest in sustainability and earth science. I would like an opportunity to develop my coding and data science skills in this field and want to get to a point where I am able to produce purposeful output that empowers people.
I have experience in earth observation and planetary science as well as geography education.
